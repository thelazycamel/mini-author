== README

This runs on old ruby/rails version and hopefully will be updated soon.

For local deployment it has been set up to work in docker, but can easily run without.

note: for setups using shoryuken/localstack and AWS you will need to ensure the importer/cms/web queues are
setup on localstack and that AWS has the correct credentials to enable importer to upload to s3, check the .env.example files
in those repositories.
